# SortingAlgo
Visual representation of different sorting algorithms using SFML and C++


**How to use:**

1. Clone the repository to your computer using the shell command:
```
git clone https://github.com/Zsivony1es/SortingAlgo.git
```
2. In the folder `SortingAlgo/lib/` clone the SFML libraries with:
```
git clone https://github.com/SFML/SFML.git
```
3. You can build the project by running the shell script `run.sh` included in the base project folder.

In the current version, the program (as far as I understand) can't link the SFML library to the executable, which results
in the error output that can be found in `SortingAlgo/TerminalOutput.txt`.
