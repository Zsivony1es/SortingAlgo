# SortingAlgo
Visual representation of different sorting algorithms using SFML and C++


**How to use:**

1. Clone the repository to your computer using the shell command:
```
git clone https://github.com/Zsivony1es/SortingAlgo.git
```
2. In the folder `SortingAlgo/lib/` clone the SFML libraries with:
```
git clone https://github.com/SFML/SFML.git
```
3. You can build the project by running the shell script `run.sh` included in the base project folder.
This script by default tries to build the project for ARM64 architecture, so if your device is running a different
one, please change that in the file accordingly.

4. After building the project, an executable file can be found in `SortingAlgo/build/app/SortingAlgo`.
